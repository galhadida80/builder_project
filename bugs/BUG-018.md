# BUG-018: No maximum limit validation for material quantity

## Severity
Medium

## Category
Materials

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to a project's Materials tab
2. Click "Add Material"
3. Try to enter extremely large quantity like 999999999999999999

## Expected Result
Should have frontend validation:
- "Quantity cannot exceed [reasonable maximum]"
- Prevent entry of unrealistic values before submission

## Actual Result
No frontend validation on maximum value
Only fails at backend level with no user feedback
Allows user to enter unrealistic quantities
