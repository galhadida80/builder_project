# BUG-026: Project Code not validated for uniqueness

## Severity
High

## Category
Projects

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Create a project with code "DOB-2026-001"
2. Try to create another project with same code "DOB-2026-001"

## Expected Result
Should show error:
- "Project Code must be unique"
- "A project with this code already exists"
- Prevent submission

## Actual Result
No uniqueness validation shown in frontend
Likely allows duplicate codes to be submitted
Backend may reject but no user feedback
