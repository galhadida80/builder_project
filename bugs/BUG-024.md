# BUG-024: Project search field has no debouncing

## Severity
Medium

## Category
Projects

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to Projects page
2. Type quickly in search field
3. Observe console for API calls

## Expected Result
Should debounce search:
- Wait for user to stop typing (300-500ms)
- Then trigger search
- Prevents excessive API calls

## Actual Result
Likely fires API call on every keystroke
Poor performance with many projects
Unnecessary server load
Network tab would show multiple rapid requests
