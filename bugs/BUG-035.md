# BUG-035: Equipment search doesn't show "No results found" message

## Severity
Low

## Category
Equipment

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to Equipment tab
2. Type non-existent equipment name in search
3. Observe results

## Expected Result
Should show clear message:
- "No equipment found matching 'search term'"
- Suggest clearing search or adjusting filters
- Different from empty state

## Actual Result
Likely shows generic "No equipment found" message
User cannot tell if search failed or there's no equipment
Confusing UX between empty and no-results states
