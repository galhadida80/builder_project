# BUG-008: Can select past date for project Start Date

## Severity
Medium

## Category
Projects

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to Projects page
2. Click "New Project"
3. Enter "2020-01-01" in Start Date field (a past date)
4. Try to submit

## Expected Result
Should either:
- Warn user "Start date cannot be in the past"
- Or allow past dates if that's intentional for documenting existing projects

## Actual Result
Past dates are accepted without warning. For new construction projects, this is likely an error
