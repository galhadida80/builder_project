# BUG-021: Overall Project Progress shows 58% with no construction areas

## Severity
High

## Category
Areas

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to a project's Areas tab
2. Observe "Overall Project Progress" showing 58%
3. Notice message "No construction areas found"

## Expected Result
With no construction areas, progress should be:
- 0% (no work defined)
- Or "N/A - No areas defined"
- Or not show the progress bar at all

## Actual Result
Shows 58% progress despite having zero areas
Misleading data - where does 58% come from?
Progress bar displayed when there's nothing to measure
