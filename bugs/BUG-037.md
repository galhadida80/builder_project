# BUG-037: Material unit field is free text instead of dropdown

## Severity
Medium

## Category
Materials

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Click "Add Material"
2. Observe Unit field
3. Try entering unit

## Expected Result
Should be dropdown with standard units:
- ton, kg, lb
- m3, cubic feet
- unit, piece
- bag, pallet
- Linear meters, feet
- Prevents typos and inconsistency

## Actual Result
Free text field with placeholder "e.g., ton, m3, unit"
Users can enter anything: "tons", "Ton", "TONS", "T"
Inconsistent data makes reporting difficult
Cannot filter or aggregate properly
