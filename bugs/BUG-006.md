# BUG-006: Inconsistent Project Code validation - spaces allowed but special chars rejected

## Severity
Medium

## Category
Projects

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to Projects page
2. Click "New Project"
3. Enter "TEST 001" (with space) in Project Code field
4. Click Create Project

## Expected Result
Should either:
- Reject spaces with validation message (consistent with "letters, numbers, hyphens only" hint)
- Or update hint text to say "letters, numbers, hyphens, and spaces"

## Actual Result
Spaces are accepted without validation error, but hint says "Letters, numbers, hyphens only"
Special characters like @#$%^&*() are correctly rejected
