# BUG-521: Session timeout not handled - user loses work

## Severity
Critical

## Category
Projects

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Fill out large form (New Project)
2. Wait for session to timeout (leave idle)
3. Try to submit form

## Expected Result
Should handle session expiry:
- Warn before timeout
- Save draft automatically
- Graceful re-authentication
- Don't lose user's work

## Actual Result
Form submission fails
User loses all entered data
No warning about session expiry
Frustrating experience
