## Severity
High

## Category
Areas

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to Areas tab
2. Try to create nested areas (Building → Floor → Room)

  - Floor 1
    - Room 101
    - Room 102
  - Floor 2
- Expand/collapse tree view

## Actual Result
Likely flat list of areas
No parent-child structure
Cannot organize by building/floor/room
