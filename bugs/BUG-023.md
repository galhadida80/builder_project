# BUG-023: No confirmation dialog when deleting project

## Severity
High

## Category
Projects

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to Projects page
2. Observe delete button (trash icon) on project card

## Expected Result
Should require confirmation:
- "Are you sure you want to delete this project?"
- Show project name in confirmation
- Warn about data loss
- Two-step deletion for safety

## Actual Result
Based on UI, delete button likely triggers immediate deletion
No protection against accidental clicks
Critical action with no safety net
