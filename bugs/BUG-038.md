# BUG-038: Expected Delivery Date allows past dates

## Severity
Medium

## Category
Materials

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Click "Add Material"
2. Set Expected Delivery Date to a past date
3. Submit form

## Expected Result
Should validate:
- "Delivery date cannot be in the past"
- Or allow past dates if tracking historical data
- Clear indication of purpose

## Actual Result
Likely accepts past dates without warning
For new orders, past delivery dates don't make sense
Could be user error that goes unnoticed
