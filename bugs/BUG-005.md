# BUG-005: No visual indication when character limit is reached

## Severity
Medium

## Category
Projects

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to Projects page
2. Click "New Project"
3. Paste or type more than 255 characters in Project Name field

## Expected Result
Should show warning when approaching limit (e.g., at 250/255) or when limit reached:
- Red colored counter
- Warning message "Maximum character limit reached"
- Visual feedback (red border on input)

## Actual Result
Counter shows "255/255" but no other visual feedback. User doesn't realize input was truncated until they review the truncated text
