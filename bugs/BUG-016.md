# BUG-016: Materials can be created with zero quantity

## Severity
Medium

## Category
Materials

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to a project's Materials tab
2. Click "Add Material"
3. Enter Material Name: "Test Material"
4. Enter Quantity: 0
5. Click Add Material

## Expected Result
Should show validation error: "Quantity must be greater than 0"

## Actual Result
Material is created successfully with 0.00 quantity
This doesn't make sense - why order 0 units of something?
Validation says "must be a positive number" for negative values but accepts 0
