# BUG-001: Character counter shows under input field even when empty

## Severity
Low

## Category
Projects

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to Projects page
2. Click "New Project" button
3. Observe the "Project Name" field

## Expected Result
Character counter should not be visible for empty fields, or should show "Required field" message

## Actual Result
Shows "0/255" immediately, which is not helpful guidance for the user. The counter should appear after user starts typing or show clearer required field indicator.
