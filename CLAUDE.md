# BuilderOps - Project Instructions

## Epic-Driven Development (MANDATORY)

Before starting any task:
1. Read `docs/LINEAR_EPICS_STORIES.md` to identify which epic(s) and stories are relevant to the work
2. Read the relevant epic folder(s) under `docs/epics/epic-{N}-{name}/` for detailed specs and context
3. Use the epic requirements to guide implementation decisions

After completing any task:
1. Update `docs/LINEAR_EPICS_STORIES.md` to reflect progress — mark stories as completed, update status, add notes
2. If a new epic folder is needed, create it under `docs/epics/`
3. Keep the documentation in sync with the actual codebase state
