  "rationale": "Users who click Settings in their profile dropdown are told the feature doesn't exist, when it actually does. This makes an existing feature undiscoverable from the primary user menu. The Settings page is only reachable via the Sidebar bottom section, which many users may not notice. The 'Profile' item also shows 'coming soon' but genuinely has no page—both items look identical, giving no indication which is real vs placeholder.",

  "problemSolved": "Header.tsx line 143: The Settings MenuItem executes: `onClick={() => { handleMenuClose(); showInfo('Settings page coming soon!'); }}`. But SettingsPage.tsx exists at pages/SettingsPage.tsx (6,650 bytes, implemented) and is routed at /settings in App.tsx line 70: `<Route path='/settings' element={<SettingsPage />} />`. The Profile MenuItem (line 139) similarly shows 'Profile page coming soon!' and there is genuinely no Profile page. Both appear active and identical, confusing users about which features are actually available."
