=== AUTO-BUILD PROGRESS ===

Project: Build Team Members Directory
Spec: 054-build-team-members-directory
Started: 2026-02-05

Workflow Type: feature
Rationale: New user-facing feature adding team members directory page. Frontend-only implementation using existing backend API.

Session 1 (Planner):
- Completed deep codebase investigation
- Identified existing patterns: TeamCard component, Dashboard page structure, API client, Sidebar navigation
- Verified backend API endpoint exists: GET /team-members
- Confirmed TeamMember interface already defined in types
- Created implementation_plan.json with 3 phases, 4 subtasks
- Created init.sh startup script
- Updated context.json with discovered patterns

Phase Summary:
- Phase 1 (Components): Create TeamMemberCard component - 1 subtask
- Phase 2 (Page): Create TeamMembersPage with API integration - 1 subtask
- Phase 3 (Integration): Add routing and navigation - 2 subtasks

Services Involved:
- frontend (primary): Create team members directory page and card components

Parallelism Analysis:
- Max parallel phases: 1 (sequential execution required)
- Recommended workers: 1
- Speedup estimate: Sequential execution required due to dependencies
- Phase dependencies: Phase 2 depends on Phase 1 (needs TeamMemberCard), Phase 3 depends on Phase 2 (needs TeamMembersPage)

Tech Stack:
- Frontend: TypeScript + React Router + Vite + MUI + Emotion
- Backend: Python + FastAPI (no changes needed)
- Testing: Vitest (unit tests)
- E2E: Playwright (optional)

Files to Create:
- frontend/src/components/TeamMemberCard.tsx
- frontend/src/pages/TeamMembersPage.tsx

Files to Modify:
- frontend/src/App.tsx (add route)
- frontend/src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx (add navigation link)

Key Patterns Discovered:
1. Routing: React Router with Routes in App.tsx, pages in src/pages/
2. API Client: axios via lib/api/client.ts with automatic auth token handling
3. Cards: MUI Card with styled() API, hover effects with transform
4. Pages: useState/useEffect for data fetching, loading/error/success states
5. Navigation: Sidebar mainNavItems array for top-level routes

Existing Implementations Referenced:
- TeamCard component: Shows pattern for MUI cards with member info
- DashboardPage: Shows pattern for API fetching, loading states, grid layouts
- API client: Shows axios setup with environment variables
- Types: TeamMember interface already exists with all needed fields

=== STARTUP COMMAND ===

To continue building this spec, run:

  source auto-claude/.venv/bin/activate && python auto-claude/run.py --spec 054 --parallel 1

Or manually start services for development:

  cd .auto-claude/specs/054-build-team-members-directory
  ./init.sh

Service URLs:
- Backend: http://localhost:8000
- API Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Team Members API: http://localhost:8000/api/v1/team-members

Verification:
- Unit tests: cd frontend && npm test
- Build: cd frontend && npm run build
- Browser: http://localhost:3000/team-members

=== END SESSION 1 ===

Next Steps:
1. Coder agent will implement subtask-1-1: Create TeamMemberCard component
2. Then implement subtask-2-1: Create TeamMembersPage with API integration
3. Then implement subtask-3-1: Add route to App.tsx
4. Finally implement subtask-3-2: Add sidebar navigation link
5. QA agent will verify all acceptance criteria

Session 2 (Coder - subtask-2-1):
- Created TeamMembersPage.tsx following DashboardPage pattern
- Implemented useState and useEffect for data fetching
- Added loading state with Skeleton components (6 skeleton cards in grid)
- Implemented error handling with toast notifications
- Added empty state with GroupIcon when no members found
- Created responsive grid layout using MUI Grid (xs=12, sm=6, md=4, lg=3)
- Created teamMembers.ts API client following equipment.ts pattern
- API client uses existing apiClient from client.ts
- Verified API endpoint responds (authentication required as expected)
- Committed changes with proper message
- Updated implementation_plan.json subtask-2-1 to "completed"

Completed: subtask-2-1 (Create TeamMembersPage with data fetching)

Session 3 (Coder - subtask-3-1):
- Added TeamMembersPage import to App.tsx
- Added route <Route path="/team-members" element={<TeamMembersPage />} />
- Route placed within ProtectedRoute and Layout sections
- Follows existing routing pattern (alongside /dashboard, /approvals, /audit routes)
- Changes committed with message: "auto-claude: subtask-3-1 - Add team members route to App.tsx"
- Updated implementation_plan.json subtask-3-1 to "completed"

Completed: subtask-3-1 (Add team members route to App.tsx)

Next Step: subtask-3-2 (Add Team Members link to Sidebar navigation)
