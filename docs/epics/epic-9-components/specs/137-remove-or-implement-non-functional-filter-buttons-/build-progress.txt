Project: Remove Non-Functional Filter Buttons
Task ID: 137
Workspace: tasks/137-remove-or-implement-non-functional-filter-buttons-
Started: 2026-02-05

Workflow Type: simple
Rationale: Single-service quick task - removing non-functional UI elements from 7 frontend pages. No backend changes, no complex dependencies, minimal overhead.

Session 1 (Planner):
- Completed deep codebase investigation
- Found 7 pages with non-functional Filter buttons
- Decision: Remove buttons rather than implement functionality
- Created implementation_plan.json
- Phases: 1 (cleanup)
- Total subtasks: 7 (one per page)
- Created init.sh for frontend development
- Created context.json with patterns and findings

Phase Summary:
- Phase 1 (Remove Filter Buttons): 7 subtasks, no dependencies
  * Subtask 1-1: Remove from ProjectsPage.tsx
  * Subtask 1-2: Remove from RFIPage.tsx
  * Subtask 1-3: Remove from EquipmentPage.tsx
  * Subtask 1-4: Remove from InspectionsPage.tsx
  * Subtask 1-5: Remove from MaterialsPage.tsx
  * Subtask 1-6: Remove from ApprovalsPage.tsx
  * Subtask 1-7: Remove from ContactsPage.tsx

Services Involved:
- frontend: Remove non-functional Filter buttons from list pages

Investigation Findings:
- All 7 pages have Button with FilterListIcon that has no onClick handler
- Pattern: Button appears in Box with SearchField, typically around lines 200-450
- Each page already has functional filtering via:
  * SearchField for text search
  * Tabs or SegmentedTabs for category/status filtering
- FilterListIcon is imported from '@mui/icons-material/FilterList'
- Import cleanup may be needed if icon not used elsewhere

Decision Rationale:
- Removing buttons is simpler and faster than implementing functionality
- Pages already have sufficient filtering capabilities (search + tabs)
- Addresses UX issue immediately - users won't click non-functional buttons
- Follows YAGNI principle - don't add features until actually needed
- Can implement advanced filtering later if requirements emerge

Parallelism Analysis:
- Max parallel phases: 1
- Recommended workers: 1
- Parallel groups: None
- Speedup estimate: N/A - sequential execution preferred for simple cleanup

=== STARTUP COMMAND ===

To continue building this spec, run:

  cd frontend && npm run dev:hmr

Or use the init script:

  ./.auto-claude/specs/137-remove-or-implement-non-functional-filter-buttons-/init.sh

=== VERIFICATION CHECKLIST ===

For each page, verify:
1. Filter button is removed from the UI
2. SearchField still present and functional
3. Tabs/SegmentedTabs still present and functional
4. No console errors in browser
5. FilterListIcon import removed if not used elsewhere

Browser verification URLs:
- http://localhost:3000/projects
- http://localhost:3000/rfi
- http://localhost:3000/equipment
- http://localhost:3000/inspections
- http://localhost:3000/materials
- http://localhost:3000/approvals
- http://localhost:3000/contacts

Build verification:
- cd frontend && npm run build (should succeed)
- cd frontend && npm run lint (should pass)
