  "rationale": "The app has zero Error Boundary components (confirmed by searching for 'ErrorBoundary' across the entire frontend src). If any component throws a runtime error (e.g., accessing a property on undefined data, a rendering bug), React unmounts the entire component tree and the user sees a blank white page with no way to recover except a full browser refresh. For a construction operations platform used on job sites, this is especially problematic.",
