Global CSS @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) in theme.ts (lines 79-84) sets all animationDuration and transitionDuration to 0.01ms, effectively disabling animations for users who prefer reduced motion. This approach covers ALL animations across 16 components without requiring component-level checks. Follows WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 2.3.3 (Level AAA) and Material Design accessibility guidelines. More performant than JavaScript-based detection. All functionality preserved with animations disabled.",
