Project: Landing Page Hero Section with Dark Theme
Spec Number: 075
Linear Issue: BUI-51
Started: 2026-02-04

Workflow Type: feature
Rationale: New feature implementation adding a complete hero section component to create a public landing page with dark theme, CTAs, and trust logos.

Session 1 (Planner):
- Investigated existing codebase patterns
- Examined CTASection and FeaturesBentoGrid components
- Confirmed MUI + styled() API pattern (not Emotion directly)
- Viewed design reference: design-assets/landing/01-hero-dark.png
- Created implementation_plan.json
- Phases: 4
- Total subtasks: 5
- Created init.sh
- Created build-progress.txt

Phase Summary:
- Phase 1 (Trust Logo Assets Setup): 1 subtask, no dependencies
  * Create assets directory structure for trust logos

- Phase 2 (Hero Component Implementation): 1 subtask, depends on Phase 1
  * Create Hero.tsx component with dark theme, construction background, headline, subtitle, CTAs, trust logos
  * Follow MUI styled() API pattern from CTASection.tsx

- Phase 3 (Landing Page Integration): 2 subtasks, depends on Phase 2
  * Create LandingPage.tsx that renders Hero component
  * Add landing page route to App.tsx (public, no auth required)

- Phase 4 (Responsive Design Verification): 1 subtask, depends on Phase 3
  * Test responsive breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop)
  * Verify accessibility compliance (WCAG AA)

Services Involved:
- frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite + MUI (primary implementation)

Design Specifications:
- Background: Dark construction site image with overlay
- Headline: "Build Smarter Inspect Faster Deliver Excellence"
- Subtitle: Value proposition text
- CTAs: "Request Demo" (blue filled) + "Login" (outlined)
- Trust Logos: TURNER CONSTRUCTION, BECHTEL, FLUOR, KIEWIT, SKANSKA

Key Patterns Identified:
- Styling: MUI's styled() from @mui/material/styles (NOT @emotion/styled)
- Structure: Single .tsx files with inline styled components
- Responsive: MUI breakpoints with sx prop and useMediaQuery
- Buttons: Custom Button components from ./ui/Button

Parallelism Analysis:
- Max parallel phases: 1
- Recommended workers: 1
- Sequential execution required due to phase dependencies
- Parallel groups: None (each phase depends on previous)

=== STARTUP COMMAND ===

To continue building this spec, run:

  source auto-claude/.venv/bin/activate && python auto-claude/run.py --spec 075 --parallel 1

Example with explicit spec number:
  source auto-claude/.venv/bin/activate && python auto-claude/run.py --spec 075 --parallel 1

=== VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS ===

Required Checks:
1. TypeScript compilation succeeds (npm run build)
2. Hero component unit tests pass
3. Visual verification matches 01-hero-dark.png design
4. Responsive at 375px, 768px, 1440px breakpoints
5. Keyboard navigation functional (Tab, Enter)
6. Color contrast meets WCAG AA standards
7. All images have descriptive alt text
8. No console errors in browser

Browser Testing:
- URL: http://localhost:3000/
- Verify: Dark hero, headline, CTAs, trust logos, responsive layout

=== END SESSION 1 ===

Session 2 (Coder - subtask-3-2):
- Completed Phase 3, Task 2: Add LandingPage route to App.tsx
- Modified frontend/src/App.tsx to:
  * Import LandingPage component
  * Add public route at "/" for LandingPage
  * Remove redirect from "/" to "/dashboard" in protected routes
  * Update wildcard redirect to point to "/" instead of "/login"
- Routing structure now:
  * "/" - LandingPage (public)
  * "/login" - LoginPage (public)
  * "/dashboard" and others - Protected routes
  * Wildcard redirects to landing page
- Changes committed: 0d24b42
