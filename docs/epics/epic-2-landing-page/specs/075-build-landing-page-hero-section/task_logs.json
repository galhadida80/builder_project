Here's a summary of my analysis:\n\n## Complexity Assessment Summary\n\n**Complexity Level:** **STANDARD**\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n1. **Scope Analysis:**\n   - Estimated 4 files to be modified (hero component, landing page, styles, assets)\n   - Single service (frontend only)\n   - Not cross-cutting - contained to landing page feature\n\n2. **Technology Stack:**\n   - Uses existing React + TypeScript + Material-UI + Emotion\n   - Design reference available at: `design-assets/landing/01-hero-dark.png`\n   - No new dependencies required\n\n3. **Risk Assessment:**\n   - **Low Risk** - Frontend-only visual component\n   - Main concerns: design accuracy, dark theme styling, responsive design\n   - No security, authentication, or data handling involved\n\n4. **Recommended Workflow:**\n   ```\n   discovery → requirements → context → spec_writing → planning → validation\n   ```\n   (6 phases - no research or self-critique needed)\n\n5. **Validation Recommendations:**\n   - **Risk Level:** LOW\n   - **Minimal Mode:** True\n   - **Tests Required:** Unit tests (if present)\n   - **Security Scan:** Not required\n   - **Staging Deployment:** Not required\n\n**Reasoning:** This is a standard frontend feature addition using the existing tech stack. It's more than a simple fix (involves multiple files and a complete hero section), but it's not complex (no external integrations, no infrastructure changes, familiar technologies).\n\nThe assessment has been saved to:\n`/Users/galhadida/projects/builder_project/builder_program/.auto-claude/specs/075-build-landing-page-hero-section/complexity_assessment.json`",

          "detail": "# Specification: Build Landing Page Hero Section\n\n## Overview\n\nBuild a dark-themed hero section for the landing page that includes prominent call-to-action (CTA) buttons and a trust logos section to establish credibility. This component will serve as the primary entry point for visitors, communicating the value proposition and encouraging user engagement. The design follows the reference mockup `01-hero-dark.png`.\n\n## Workflow Type\n\n**Type**: feature\n\n**Rationale**: This is a new feature implementation that adds a complete hero section component to the landing page. It involves creating new UI components, implementing responsive design, and integrating brand assets (trust logos).\n\n## Task Scope\n\n### Services Involved\n- **frontend** (primary) - React application where the hero section will be implemented\n\n### This Task Will:\n- [ ] Create a new Hero component with dark theme styling\n- [ ] Implement responsive hero section layout that works across mobile, tablet, and desktop\n- [ ] Add CTA button components with appropriate styling and hover states\n- [ ] Create a trust logos section displaying partner/brand logos\n- [ ] Integrate the hero section into the landing page\n- [ ] Ensure accessibility standards (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, contrast ratios)\n- [ ] Match the design specifications from 01-hero-dark.png reference\n\n### Out of Scope:\n- Backend API integration for dynamic content (hero text will be static for now)\n- A/B testing implementation\n- Analytics tracking integration\n- CTA button click handlers beyond basic navigation\n- Logo carousel/animation effects (static display only)\n- Multi-language support (English only for initial implementation)\n\n## Service Context\n\n### frontend\n\n**Tech Stack:**\n- Language: TypeScript\n- Framework: React\n- Build Tool: Vite\n- Styling: Emotion (CSS-in-JS)\n- Key Dependencies: @emotion/react, @emotion/styled, @mui/material, @mui/icons-material\n\n**Entry Point:** `src/App.tsx`\n\n**How to Run:**\n```bash\ncd frontend\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n**Port:** 3000\n\n**Key Directories:**\n- `src/` - Source code directory\n- `src/components/` - Reusable React components (likely location for Hero component)\n- `src/pages/` - Page-level components (likely location for Landing page)\n- `src/assets/` - Static assets (images, logos)\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n| File | Service | What to Change |\n|------|---------|---------------|\n| `frontend/src/components/Hero.tsx` | frontend | Create new component for hero section with dark theme |\n| `frontend/src/components/Hero.styles.ts` | frontend | Create Emotion styled components for hero styling |\n| `frontend/src/pages/LandingPage.tsx` (or similar) | frontend | Import and render Hero component |\n| `frontend/src/assets/logos/` | frontend | Add trust logo image assets |\n\n**Note:** The exact file paths may vary based on the existing project structure. These paths are based on common React project conventions.\n\n## Files to Reference\n\nThese files should be examined to understand existing patterns:\n\n| File | Pattern to Copy |\n|------|----------------|\n| `frontend/src/App.tsx` | Entry point structure and routing patterns |\n| Existing components in `frontend/src/components/` | Component structure, TypeScript typing, Emotion styling patterns |\n| Design reference: `01-hero-dark.png` | Visual design specifications (colors, spacing, layout) |\n\n**Note:** Since the discovery phase did not identify specific reference files, the implementation should follow Material-UI and Emotion best practices as indicated by the project dependencies.\n\n## Patterns to Follow\n\n### Emotion Styled Components Pattern\n\nBased on the project's use of Emotion, components should follow this pattern:\n\n```typescript\nimport styled from '@emotion/styled';\n\n// Define styled components\nexport const HeroContainer = styled.div`\n  background-color: #1a1a1a; /* Dark theme */\n  padding: 80px 20px;\n  min-height: 600px;\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: column;\n  align-items: center;\n  justify-content: center;\n`;\n\nexport const HeroTitle = styled.h1`\n  color: #ffffff;\n  font-size: 3rem;\n  font-weight: bold;\n  text-align: center;\n  margin-bottom: 1.5rem;\n\n  @media (max-width: 768px) {\n    font-size: 2rem;\n  }\n`;\n```\n\n**Key Points:**\n- Use Emotion's styled API for component styling\n- Implement responsive design with media queries\n- Follow dark theme color scheme\n- Maintain type safety with TypeScript\n\n### React Component Structure Pattern\n\n```typescript\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { HeroContainer, HeroTitle, CTAButton } from './Hero.styles';\n\ninterface HeroProps {\n  title: string;\n  subtitle: string;\n  ctaPrimary: string;\n  ctaSecondary?: string;\n}\n\nexport const Hero: React.FC<HeroProps> = ({\n  title,\n  subtitle,\n  ctaPrimary,\n  ctaSecondary\n}) => {\n  return (\n    <HeroContainer>\n      <HeroTitle>{title}</HeroTitle>\n      {/* Component implementation */}\n    </HeroContainer>\n  );\n};\n```\n\n**Key Points:**\n- Define TypeScript interfaces for props\n- Use functional components with React.FC\n- Separate styled components from logic\n\n### Material-UI Integration Pattern\n\nSince the project uses Material-UI, consider using MUI components where appropriate:\n\n```typescript\nimport { Button, Container, Typography } from '@mui/material';\nimport { styled } from '@emotion/styled';\n\n// Can extend MUI components with Emotion\nconst StyledButton = styled(Button)`\n  background: linear-gradient(45deg, #2196F3 30%, #21CBF3 90%);\n  color: white;\n  padding: 12px 30px;\n  border-radius: 8px;\n`;\n```\n\n**Key Points:**\n- Leverage existing MUI components for accessibility and consistency\n- Extend MUI components with Emotion for custom styling\n- Use MUI's theming system if available\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n1. **Dark Theme Hero Container**\n   - Description: A full-width hero section with dark background that contrasts with light text and CTAs\n   - Acceptance:\n     - Background color is dark (e.g., #1a1a1a or similar dark shade)\n     - Text is highly readable (WCAG AA contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1)\n     - Section spans full viewport width\n     - Minimum height ensures content is above the fold on desktop\n\n2. **Primary and Secondary CTA Buttons**\n   - Description: Two distinct call-to-action buttons with different visual hierarchy\n   - Acceptance:\n     - Primary CTA is visually prominent (filled, bright color)\n     - Secondary CTA is less prominent (outlined or secondary color)\n     - Both buttons have hover states\n     - Buttons are keyboard accessible (focus states visible)\n     - Click events can be attached (onClick handlers available)\n\n3. **Trust Logos Section**\n   - Description: Display of partner/client logos to establish credibility\n   - Acceptance:\n     - Logos are displayed in a horizontal row (or grid on mobile)\n     - Logos are appropriately sized and maintain aspect ratio\n     - Section is clearly separated from hero content (visual divider or spacing)\n     - Alt text is provided for accessibility\n\n4. **Responsive Design**\n   - Description: Hero section adapts to different screen sizes\n   - Acceptance:\n     - Desktop (≥1024px): Full layout with large typography\n     - Tablet (768px-1023px): Adjusted spacing and font sizes\n     - Mobile (≤767px): Stacked layout, smaller typography, adjusted CTA button sizing\n     - No horizontal scrolling on any breakpoint\n     - Touch targets are at least 44x44px on mobile\n\n5. **Accessibility Compliance**\n   - Description: Hero section meets WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards\n   - Acceptance:\n     - All interactive elements are keyboard navigable\n     - Focus indicators are visible\n     - ARIA labels are provided where needed\n     - Color contrast ratios meet standards\n     - Semantic HTML elements are used\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n1. **Long Hero Text** - If title or subtitle is longer than expected, implement text overflow handling (ellipsis or wrap) to prevent layout breaking\n\n2. **Missing Logo Assets** - Display placeholder or gracefully hide logo section if assets are not available\n\n3. **Small Viewport Heights** - On very short screens (e.g., landscape mobile), ensure hero doesn't take up more than viewport height to allow scrolling to content below\n\n4. **High Contrast Mode** - Ensure component remains usable in browser high contrast mode for accessibility\n\n5. **Logo Count Variations** - Trust logos section should handle 3-6 logos gracefully, adjusting spacing as needed\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n### DO\n- Follow the design specifications in `01-hero-dark.png` exactly for colors, spacing, and layout\n- Use Emotion styled components consistently throughout the implementation\n- Leverage Material-UI components (Button, Typography, Container) where appropriate for consistency\n- Implement responsive breakpoints at 768px (tablet) and 1024px (desktop)\n- Use semantic HTML elements (header, section, h1, etc.) for better accessibility and SEO\n- Test with keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Space keys)\n- Ensure all images have descriptive alt text\n- Use TypeScript interfaces for all component props\n- Create separate files for component logic (Hero.tsx) and styles (Hero.styles.ts)\n\n### DON'T\n- Don't hard-code pixel values everywhere - use consistent spacing variables or theme values\n- Don't use inline styles - all styling should be in Emotion styled components\n- Don't skip responsive testing - verify on actual devices or browser dev tools\n- Don't forget focus states - keyboard users need visible focus indicators\n- Don't use generic alt text like \"logo\" - be descriptive (e.g., \"Acme Corp logo\")\n- Don't make assumptions about CTA destinations - accept them as props or use placeholder links\n- Don't implement complex animations in the first iteration - keep it simple and functional\n\n## Development Environment\n\n### Start Services\n\n```bash\n# Start frontend development server\ncd frontend\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n### Service URLs\n- Frontend: http://localhost:3000\n\n### Required Environment Variables\n\nBased on the project structure, no additional environment variables are required for the hero section implementation. The frontend uses:\n\n```\nVITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/v1\n```\n\nThis is already configured but not needed for static hero section.\n\n## Success Criteria\n\nThe task is complete when:\n\n1. [ ] Hero component is created and renders correctly with dark theme\n\n\n... [truncated - full output was 15637 chars]",

Here's what was created:\n\n### 📋 Files Created\n\n1. **implementation_plan.json** - Comprehensive subtask-based implementation plan\n2. **init.sh** - Development environment setup script  \n3. **build-progress.txt** - Progress tracking document\n4. **context.json** - Updated with codebase patterns and file references\n\n### 🔍 Key Findings from Codebase Investigation\n\n**Existing Patterns Discovered:**\n- ✅ **Styling**: Uses MUI's `styled()` API from `@mui/material/styles` (NOT `@emotion/styled` directly)\n- ✅ **Component Structure**: Single `.tsx` files with inline styled components (no separate `.styles.ts` files)\n- ✅ **Reference Components**: Found `CTASection.tsx` and `FeaturesBentoGrid.tsx` with similar patterns\n- ✅ **Design Reference**: Reviewed `design-assets/landing/01-hero-dark.png` showing dark hero with construction background, headline, CTAs, and 5 trust logos\n\n**Tech Stack:**\n- React + TypeScript + Vite\n- Material-UI (MUI) for components\n- Port 3000 for frontend\n\n### 📊 Implementation Plan Summary\n\n**Workflow Type:** Feature (new component implementation)\n\n**4 Phases, 5 Subtasks:**\n\n1. **Phase 1 - Trust Logo Assets Setup** (1 subtask)\n   - Create assets directory structure\n\n2. **Phase 2 - Hero Component** (1 subtask)\n   - Build Hero.tsx with dark theme, construction background, headline, subtitle, CTAs, trust logos\n   - Follow MUI styled() pattern from existing components\n\n3. **Phase 3 - Landing Page Integration** (2 subtasks)\n   - Create LandingPage.tsx component\n   - Add public route to App.tsx (accessible without auth)\n\n4. **Phase 4 - Responsive Verification** (1 subtask)\n   - Test mobile (375px), tablet (768px), desktop (1440px)\n   - Verify accessibility (WCAG AA)\n\n**Parallelism:** Sequential execution (recommended: 1 worker)\n\n### ✅ Next Steps\n\nA separate coder agent will now:\n1. Read the implementation plan\n2. Execute subtasks in order (respecting dependencies)\n3. Follow the MUI styled() patterns found in CTASection.tsx\n4. Match the design specifications from 01-hero-dark.png\n\n**To start implementation:**\n```bash\nsource auto-claude/.venv/bin/activate && python auto-claude/run.py --spec 075 --parallel 1\n```\n\n**Note:** Planning files are gitignored and managed locally - only code changes will be committed.",

Description: A full-width hero section with dark background that contrasts with light text and CTAs\n   185→   - Acceptance:\n   186→     - Background color is dark (e.g., #1a1a1a or similar dark shade)\n   187→     - Text is highly readable (WCAG AA contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1)\n   188→     - Section spans full viewport width\n   189→     - Minimum height ensures content is above the fold on desktop\n   190→\n   191→2. **Primary and Secondary CTA Buttons**\n   192→   - Description: Two distinct call-to-action buttons with different visual hierarchy\n   193→   - Acceptance:\n   194→     - Primary CTA is visually prominent (filled, bright color)\n   195→     - Secondary CTA is less prominent (outlined or secondary color)\n   196→     - Both buttons have hover states\n   197→     - Buttons are keyboard accessible (focus states visible)\n   198→     - Click events can be attached (onClick handlers available)\n   199→\n   200→3. **Trust Logos Section**\n   201→   - Description: Display of partner/client logos to establish credibility\n   202→   - Acceptance:\n   203→     - Logos are displayed in a horizontal row (or grid on mobile)\n   204→     - Logos are appropriately sized and maintain aspect ratio\n   205→     - Section is clearly separated from hero content (visual divider or spacing)\n   206→     - Alt text is provided for accessibility\n   207→\n   208→4. **Responsive Design**\n   209→   - Description: Hero section adapts to different screen sizes\n   210→   - Acceptance:\n   211→     - Desktop (≥1024px): Full layout with large typography\n   212→     - Tablet (768px-1023px): Adjusted spacing and font sizes\n   213→     - Mobile (≤767px): Stacked layout, smaller typography, adjusted CTA button sizing\n   214→     - No horizontal scrolling on any breakpoint\n   215→     - Touch targets are at least 44x44px on mobile\n   216→\n   217→5. **Accessibility Compliance**\n   218→   - Description: Hero section meets WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards\n   219→   - Acceptance:\n   220→     - All interactive elements are keyboard navigable\n   221→     - Focus indicators are visible\n   222→     - ARIA labels are provided where needed\n   223→     - Color contrast ratios meet standards\n   224→     - Semantic HTML elements are used\n   225→\n   226→### Edge Cases\n   227→\n   228→1. **Long Hero Text** - If title or subtitle is longer than expected, implement text overflow handling (ellipsis or wrap) to prevent layout breaking\n   229→\n   230→2. **Missing Logo Assets** - Display placeholder or gracefully hide logo section if assets are not available\n   231→\n   232→3. **Small Viewport Heights** - On very short screens (e.g., landscape mobile), ensure hero doesn't take up more than viewport height to allow scrolling to content below\n   233→\n   234→4. **High Contrast Mode** - Ensure component remains usable in browser high contrast mode for accessibility\n   235→\n   236→5. **Logo Count Variations** - Trust logos section should handle 3-6 logos gracefully, adjusting spacing as needed\n   237→\n   238→## Implementation Notes\n   239→\n   240→### DO\n   241→- Follow the design specifications in `01-hero-dark.png` exactly for colors, spacing, and layout\n   242→- Use Emotion styled components consistently throughout the implementation\n   2\n\n...

Description: A full-width hero section with dark background that contrasts with light text and CTAs\n   185→   - Acceptance:\n   186→     - Background color is dark (e.g., #1a1a1a or similar dark shade)\n   187→     - Text is highly readable (WCAG AA contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1)\n   188→     - Section spans full viewport width\n   189→     - Minimum height ensures content is above the fold on desktop\n   190→\n   191→2. **Primary and Secondary CTA Buttons**\n   192→   - Description: Two distinct call-to-action buttons with different visual hierarchy\n   193→   - Acceptance:\n   194→     - Primary CTA is visually prominent (filled, bright color)\n   195→     - Secondary CTA is less prominent (outlined or secondary color)\n   196→     - Both buttons have hover states\n   197→     - Buttons are keyboard accessible (focus states visible)\n   198→     - Click events can be attached (onClick handlers available)\n   199→\n   200→3. **Trust Logos Section**\n   201→   - Description: Display of partner/client logos to establish credibility\n   202→   - Acceptance:\n   203→     - Logos are displayed in a horizontal row (or grid on mobile)\n   204→     - Logos are appropriately sized and maintain aspect ratio\n   205→     - Section is clearly separated from hero content (visual divider or spacing)\n   206→     - Alt text is provided for accessibility\n   207→\n   208→4. **Responsive Design**\n   209→   - Description: Hero section adapts to different screen sizes\n   210→   - Acceptance:\n   211→     - Desktop (≥1024px): Full layout with large typography\n   212→     - Tablet (768px-1023px): Adjusted spacing and font sizes\n   213→     - Mobile (≤767px): Stacked layout, smaller typography, adjusted CTA button sizing\n   214→     - No horizontal scrolling on any breakpoint\n   215→     - Touch targets are at least 44x44px on mobile\n   216→\n   217→5. **Accessibility Compliance**\n   218→   - Description: Hero section meets WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards\n   219→   - Acceptance:\n   220→     - All interactive elements are keyboard navigable\n   221→     - Focus indicators are visible\n   222→     - ARIA labels are provided where needed\n   223→     - Color contrast ratios meet standards\n   224→     -

Description: A full-width hero section with dark background that contrasts with light text and CTAs\n   185→   - Acceptance:\n   186→     - Background color is dark (e.g., #1a1a1a or similar dark shade)\n   187→     - Text is highly readable (WCAG AA contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1)\n   188→     - Section spans full viewport width\n   189→     - Minimum height ensures content is above the fold on desktop\n   190→\n   191→2. **Primary and Secondary CTA Buttons**\n   192→   - Description: Two distinct call-to-action buttons with different visual hierarchy\n   193→   - Acceptance:\n   194→     - Primary CTA is visually prominent (filled, bright color)\n   195→     - Secondary CTA is less prominent (outlined or secondary color)\n   196→     - Both buttons have hover states\n   197→     - Buttons are keyboard accessible (focus states visible)\n   198→     - Click events can be attached (onClick handlers available)\n   199→\n   200→3. **Trust Logos Section**\n   201→   - Description: Display of partner/client logos to establish credibility\n   202→   - Acceptance:\n   203→     - Logos are displayed in a horizontal row (or grid on mobile)\n   204→     - Logos are appropriately sized and maintain aspect ratio\n   205→     - Section is clearly separated from hero content (visual divider or spacing)\n   206→     - Alt text is provided for accessibility\n   207→\n   208→4. **Responsive Design**\n   209→   - Description: Hero section adapts to different screen sizes\n   210→   - Acceptance:\n   211→     - Desktop (≥1024px): Full layout with large typography\n   212→     - Tablet (768px-1023px): Adjusted spacing and font sizes\n   213→     - Mobile (≤767px): Stacked layout, smaller typography, adjusted CTA button sizing\n   214→     - No horizontal scrolling on any breakpoint\n   215→     - Touch targets are at least 44x44px on mobile\n   216→\n   217→5. **Accessibility Compliance**\n   218→   - Description: Hero section meets WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards\n   219→   - Acceptance:\n   220→     - All interactive elements are keyboard navigable\n   221→     - Focus indicators are visible\n   222→     - ARIA labels are provided where needed\n   223→     - Color contrast ratios meet standards\n   224→     - Semantic HTML elements are used\n   225→\n   226→### Edge Cases\n   227→\n   228→1. **Long Hero Text** - If title or subtitle is longer than expected, implement text overflow handling (ellipsis or wrap) to prevent layout breaking\n   229→\n   230→2. **Missing Logo Assets** - Display placeholder or gracefully hide logo section if assets are not available\n   231→\n   232→3. **Small Viewport Heights** - On very short screens (e.g., landscape mobile), ensure hero doesn't take up more than viewport height to allow scrolling to content below\n   233→\n   234→4. **High Contrast Mode** - Ensure component remains usable in browser high contrast mode for accessibility\n   235→\n   236→5. **Logo Count Variations** - Trust logos section should handle 3-6 logos gracefully, adjusting spacing as needed\n   237→\n   238→## Implementation Notes\n   239→\n   240→### DO\n   241→- Follow the design specifications in `01-hero-dark.png` exactly for colors, spacing, and layout\n   242→- Use Emotion styled components consistently throughout the implementation\n   2\n\n...

Description: A full-width hero section with dark background that contrasts with light text and CTAs\n   185→   - Acceptance:\n   186→     - Background color is dark (e.g., #1a1a1a or similar dark shade)\n   187→     - Text is highly readable (WCAG AA contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1)\n   188→     - Section spans full viewport width\n   189→     - Minimum height ensures content is above the fold on desktop\n   190→\n   191→2. **Primary and Secondary CTA Buttons**\n   192→   - Description: Two distinct call-to-action buttons with different visual hierarchy\n   193→   - Acceptance:\n   194→     - Primary CTA is visually prominent (filled, bright color)\n   195→     - Secondary CTA is less prominent (outlined or secondary color)\n   196→     - Both buttons have hover states\n   197→     - Buttons are keyboard accessible (focus states visible)\n   198→     - Click events can be attached (onClick handlers available)\n   199→\n   200→3. **Trust Logos Section**\n   201→   - Description: Display of partner/client logos to establish credibility\n   202→   - Acceptance:\n   203→     - Logos are displayed in a horizontal row (or grid on mobile)\n   204→     - Logos are appropriately sized and maintain aspect ratio\n   205→     - Section is clearly separated from hero content (visual divider or spacing)\n   206→     - Alt text is provided for accessibility\n   207→\n   208→4. **Responsive Design**\n   209→   - Description: Hero section adapts to different screen sizes\n   210→   - Acceptance:\n   211→     - Desktop (≥1024px): Full layout with large typography\n   212→     - Tablet (768px-1023px): Adjusted spacing and font sizes\n   213→     - Mobile (≤767px): Stacked layout, smaller typography, adjusted CTA button sizing\n   214→     - No horizontal scrolling on any breakpoint\n   215→     - Touch targets are at least 44x44px on mobile\n   216→\n   217→5. **Accessibility Compliance**\n   218→   - Description: Hero section meets WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards\n   219→   - Acceptance:\n   220→     - All interactive elements are keyboard navigable\n   221→     - Focus indicators are visible\n   222→     - ARIA labels are provided where needed\n   223→     - Color contrast ratios meet standards\n   224→     - Semantic HTML elements are used\n   225→\n   226→### Edge Cases\n   227→\n   228→1. **Long Hero Text** - If title or subtitle is longer than expected, implement text overflow handling (ellipsis or wrap) to prevent layout breaking\n   229→\n   230→2. **Missing Logo Assets** - Display placeholder or gracefully hide logo section if assets are not available\n   231→\n   232→3. **Small Viewport Heights** - On very short screens (e.g., landscape mobile), ensure hero doesn't take up more than viewport height to allow scrolling to content below\n   233→\n   234→4. **High Contrast Mode** - Ensure component remains usable in browser high contrast mode for accessibility\n   235→\n   236→5. **Logo Count Variations** - Trust logos section should handle 3-6 logos gracefully, adjusting spacing as needed\n   237→\n   238→## Implementation Notes\n   239→\n   240→### DO\n   241→- Follow the design specifications in `01-hero-dark.png` exactly for colors, spacing, and layout\n   242→- Use Emotion styled components consistently throughout the implementation\n   2\n\n...

Create Unit Tests for Hero Component\n    10→\n    11→**Problem**: No unit tests exist. The spec explicitly requires `Hero.test.tsx` with tests for rendering, props, click handlers, and logo display.\n    12→\n    13→**Location**: `frontend/src/components/Hero.test.tsx` (file does not exist)\n    14→\n    15→**Required Fix**: Create a comprehensive test file with the following test cases:\n    16→1. Component renders with default props\n    17→2. Component renders with custom title and subtitle\n    18→3. CTA click handlers are called correctly\n    19→4. Trust logos render when provided\n    20→5. Trust logos are hidden when showTrustLogos is false\n    21→\n    22→**Test Framework**: Use React Testing Library (@testing-library/react)\n    23→\n    24→**Example Test Structure**:\n    25→```typescript\n    26→import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react'\n    27→import { Hero } from './Hero'\n    28→\n    29→describe('Hero Component', () => {\n    30→  it('renders with default props', () => {\n    31→    render(<Hero />)\n    32→    expect(screen.getByText(/Build Smarter/)).toBeInTheDocument()\n    33→  })\n    34→\n    35→  it('calls CTA handlers on click', () => {\n    36→    const primaryHandler = jest.fn()\n    37→    const secondaryHandler = jest.fn()\n    38→    render(\n    39→      <Hero\n    40→        ctaPrimaryAction={primaryHandler}\n    41→        ctaSecondaryAction={secondaryHandler}\n    42→      />\n    43→    )\n    44→    fireEvent.click(screen.getByText('Request Demo'))\n    45→    fireEvent.click(screen.getByText('Login'))\n    46→    expect(primaryHandler).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)\n    47→    expect(secondaryHandler).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)\n    48→  })\n    49→\n    50→  // Additional tests for props, logos, etc.\n    51→})\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→**Verification**:\n    55→- Run `npm test -- Hero.test`\n    56→- All tests should pass\n    57→- Coverage should include component rendering, props, and interactions\n    58→\n    59→---\n    60→\n    61→### 2. Enable Trust Logos Feature\n    62→\n    63→**Problem**: The `showTrustLogos` prop is set to `false` in `LandingPage.tsx`, which completely hides the trust logos section. The spec requires trust logos to be displayed.\n    64→\n    65→**Location**: `frontend/src/pages/LandingPage.tsx:32`\n    66→\n    67→**Required Fix**:\n    68→1. Change `showTrustLogos={false}` to `showTrustLogos={true}`\n    69→2. Define a `trustLogos` array with data for 5 companies\n    70→3. Pass the `trustLogos` array to the Hero component\n    71→\n    72→**Code Changes**:\n    73→```typescript\n    74→// Add this near the top of the LandingPage component\n    75→const trustLogos = [\n    76→  {\n    77→    name: 'Turner Construction',\n    78→    imageUrl: '/src/assets/logos/turner.png',\n    79→    alt: 'Turner Construction logo'\n    80→  },\n    81→  {\n    82→    name: 'Bechtel',\n    83→    imageUrl: '/src/assets/logos/bechtel.png',\n    84→    alt: 'Bechtel logo'\n    85→  },\n    86→  {\n    87→    name: 'Fluor',\n    88→    imageUrl: '/src/assets/logos/fluor.png',\n    89→    alt: 'Fluor logo'\n    90→  },\n    91→  {\n    92→    name: 'Kiewit',\n    93→    imageUrl: '/src/assets/logos/kiewit.png',\n    94→    alt: 'Kiewit logo'\n    95→  },\n    96→  {\n    97→    name: 'Skanska',\n    98→    imageUrl: '/src/assets/logos/skanska.png',\n    99→    alt: 'Skanska logo'\n   100→  },\n   101→]\n   102→\n   103→// In the Hero component JSX:\n   104→<Hero\n   105→  title=\"Build Smarter Inspect Faster Deliver Excellence\"\n   106→  subtitle=\"Streamline your construction management with our comprehensive platform.

Add Trust Logo Image Assets\n   124→\n   125→**Problem**: No actual logo image files exist in the `frontend/src/assets/logos/` directory. Only a `.gitkeep` file is present.\n   126→\n   127→**Location**: `frontend/src/assets/logos/`\n   128→\n   129→**Required Fix**: Add 5 logo image files for the following companies:\n   130→- Turner Construction → `turner.png` (or .svg)\n   131→- Bechtel → `bechtel.png` (or .svg)\n   132→- Fluor → `fluor.png` (or .svg)\n   133→- Kiewit → `kiewit.png` (or .svg)\n   134→- Skanska → `skanska.png` (or .svg)\n   135→\n   136→**Options**:\n   137→1. **Preferred**: Use actual company logos (ensure proper licensing/permissions)\n   138→2. **Alternative**: Create placeholder images with company names as text\n   139→3. **Quick Fix**: Use a placeholder service like https://via.placeholder.com/150x50/1a1a1a/ffffff?text=CompanyName\n   140→\n   141→**Image Requirements**:\n   142→- Format: PNG or SVG\n   143→- Dimensions: Approximately 120x40px (will be constrained by CSS)\n   144→- Background: Transparent or white\n   145→- Color: Ideally color logos (CSS will apply grayscale filter)\n   146→\n   147→**Verification**:\n   148→- 5 image files should exist in `frontend/src/assets/logos/`\n   149→- Files should be accessible and loadable\n   150→- Images should display correctly when Hero component is rendered\n   151→\n   152→---\n   153→\n   154→### 4.

Description: A full-width hero section with dark background that contrasts with light text and CTAs\n   185→   - Acceptance:\n   186→     - Background color is dark (e.g., #1a1a1a or similar dark shade)\n   187→     - Text is highly readable (WCAG AA contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1)\n   188→     - Section spans full viewport width\n   189→     - Minimum height ensures content is above the fold on desktop\n   190→\n   191→2. **Primary and Secondary CTA Buttons**\n   192→   - Description: Two distinct call-to-action buttons with different visual hierarchy\n   193→   - Acceptance:\n   194→     - Primary CTA is visually prominent (filled, bright color)\n   195→     - Secondary CTA is less prominent (outlined or secondary color)\n   196→     - Both buttons have hover states\n   197→     - Buttons are keyboard accessible (focus states visible)\n   198→     - Click events can be attached (onClick handlers available)\n   199→\n   200→3. **Trust Logos Section**\n   201→   - Description: Display of partner/client logos to establish credibility\n   202→   - Acceptance:\n   203→     - Logos are displayed in a horizontal row (or grid on mobile)\n   204→     - Logos are appropriately sized and maintain aspect ratio\n   205→     - Section is clearly separated from hero content (visual divider or spacing)\n   206→     - Alt text is provided for accessibility\n   207→\n   208→4. **Responsive Design**\n   209→   - Description: Hero section adapts to different screen sizes\n   210→   - Acceptance:\n   211→     - Desktop (≥1024px): Full layout with large typography\n   212→     - Tablet (768px-1023px): Adjusted spacing and font sizes\n   213→     - Mobile (≤767px): Stacked layout, smaller typography, adjusted CTA button sizing\n   214→     - No horizontal scrolling on any breakpoint\n   215→     - Touch targets are at least 44x44px on mobile\n   216→\n   217→5. **Accessibility Compliance**\n   218→   - Description: Hero section meets WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards\n   219→   - Acceptance:\n   220→     - All interactive elements are keyboard navigable\n   221→     - Focus indicators are visible\n   222→     - ARIA labels are provided where needed\n   223→     - Color contrast ratios meet standards\n   224→     - Semantic HTML elements are used\n   225→\n   226→### Edge Cases\n   227→\n   228→1. **Long Hero Text** - If title or subtitle is longer than expected, implement text overflow handling (ellipsis or wrap) to prevent layout breaking\n   229→\n   230→2. **Missing Logo Assets** - Display placeholder or gracefully hide logo section if assets are not available\n   231→\n   232→3. **Small Viewport Heights** - On very short screens (e.g., landscape mobile), ensure hero doesn't take up more than viewport height to allow scrolling to content below\n   233→\n   234→4. **High Contrast Mode** - Ensure component remains usable in browser high contrast mode for accessibility\n   235→\n   236→5. **Logo Count Variations** - Trust logos section should handle 3-6 logos gracefully, adjusting spacing as needed\n   237→\n   238→## Implementation Notes\n   239→\n   240→### DO\n   241→- Follow the design specifications in `01-hero-dark.png` exactly for colors, spacing, and layout\n   242→- Use Emotion styled components consistently throughout the implementation\n   2\n\n...

Display placeholder or gracefully hide logo section if assets are not available\n   231→\n   232→3. **Small Viewport Heights** - On very short screens (e.g., landscape mobile), ensure hero doesn't take up more than viewport height to allow scrolling to content below\n   233→\n   234→4. **High Contrast Mode** - Ensure component remains usable in browser high contrast mode for accessibility\n   235→\n   236→5. **Logo Count Variations** - Trust logos section should handle 3-6 logos gracefully, adjusting spacing as needed\n   237→\n   238→## Implementation Notes\n   239→\n   240→### DO\n   241→- Follow the design specifications in `01-hero-dark.png` exactly for colors, spacing, and layout\n   242→- Use Emotion styled components consistently throughout the implementation\n   2\n\n...

Create Unit Tests for Hero Component\n    10→\n    11→**Problem**: No unit tests exist.

Component renders with default props\n    17→2. Component renders with custom title and subtitle\n    18→3. CTA click handlers are called correctly\n    19→4. Trust logos render when provided\n    20→5. Trust logos are hidden when showTrustLogos is false\n    21→\n    22→**Test Framework**: Use React Testing Library (@testing-library/react)\n    23→\n    24→**Example Test Structure**:\n    25→```typescript\n    26→import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react'\n    27→import { Hero } from './Hero'\n    28→\n    29→describe('Hero Component', () => {\n    30→  it('renders with default props', () => {\n    31→    render(<Hero />)\n    32→    expect(screen.getByText(/Build Smarter/)).toBeInTheDocument()\n    33→  })\n    34→\n    35→  it('calls CTA handlers on click', () => {\n    36→    const primaryHandler = jest.fn()\n    37→    const secondaryHandler = jest.fn()\n    38→    render(\n    39→      <Hero\n    40→        ctaPrimaryAction={primaryHandler}\n    41→        ctaSecondaryAction={secondaryHandler}\n    42→      />\n    43→    )\n    44→    fireEvent.click(screen.getByText('Request Demo'))\n    45→    fireEvent.click(screen.getByText('Login'))\n    46→    expect(primaryHandler).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)\n    47→    expect(secondaryHandler).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)\n    48→  })\n    49→\n    50→  // Additional tests for props, logos, etc.\n    51→})\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→**Verification**:\n    55→- Run `npm test -- Hero.test`\n    56→- All tests should pass\n    57→- Coverage should include component rendering, props, and interactions\n    58→\n    59→---\n    60→\n    61→### 2. Enable Trust Logos Feature\n    62→\n    63→**Problem**: The `showTrustLogos` prop is set to `false` in `LandingPage.tsx`, which completely hides the trust logos section. The spec requires trust logos to be displayed.\n    64→\n    65→**Location**: `frontend/src/pages/LandingPage.tsx:32`\n    66→\n    67→**Required Fix**:\n    68→1. Change `showTrustLogos={false}` to `showTrustLogos={true}`\n    69→2. Define a `trustLogos` array with data for 5 companies\n    70→3. Pass the `trustLogos` array to the Hero component\n    71→\n    72→**Code Changes**:\n    73→```typescript\n    74→// Add this near the top of the LandingPage component\n    75→const trustLogos = [\n    76→  {\n    77→    name: 'Turner Construction',\n    78→    imageUrl: '/src/assets/logos/turner.png',\n    79→    alt: 'Turner Construction logo'\n    80→  },\n    81→  {\n    82→    name: 'Bechtel',\n    83→    imageUrl: '/src/assets/logos/bechtel.png',\n    84→    alt: 'Bechtel logo'\n    85→  },\n    86→  {\n    87→    name: 'Fluor',\n    88→    imageUrl: '/src/assets/logos/fluor.png',\n    89→    alt: 'Fluor logo'\n    90→  },\n    91→  {\n    92→    name: 'Kiewit',\n    93→    imageUrl: '/src/assets/logos/kiewit.png',\n    94→    alt: 'Kiewit logo'\n    95→  },\n    96→  {\n    97→    name: 'Skanska',\n    98→    imageUrl: '/src/assets/logos/skanska.png',\n    99→    alt: 'Skanska logo'\n   100→  },\n   101→]\n   102→\n   103→// In the Hero component JSX:\n   104→<Hero\n   105→  title=\"Build Smarter Inspect Faster Deliver Excellence\"\n   106→  subtitle=\"Streamline your construction management with our comprehensive platform.

Description: A full-width hero section with dark background that contrasts with light text and CTAs\n   185→   - Acceptance:\n   186→     - Background color is dark (e.g., #1a1a1a or similar dark shade)\n   187→     - Text is highly readable (WCAG AA contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1)\n   188→     - Section spans full viewport width\n   189→     - Minimum height ensures content is above the fold on desktop\n   190→\n   191→2. **Primary and Secondary CTA Buttons**\n   192→   - Description: Two distinct call-to-action buttons with different visual hierarchy\n   193→   - Acceptance:\n   194→     - Primary CTA is visually prominent (filled, bright color)\n   195→     - Secondary CTA is less prominent (outlined or secondary color)\n   196→     - Both buttons have hover states\n   197→     - Buttons are keyboard accessible (focus states visible)\n   198→     - Click events can be attached (onClick handlers available)\n   199→\n   200→3. **Trust Logos Section**\n   201→   - Description: Display of partner/client logos to establish credibility\n   202→   - Acceptance:\n   203→     - Logos are displayed in a horizontal row (or grid on mobile)\n   204→     - Logos are appropriately sized and maintain aspect ratio\n   205→     - Section is clearly separated from hero content (visual divider or spacing)\n   206→     - Alt text is provided for accessibility\n   207→\n   208→4. **Responsive Design**\n   209→   - Description: Hero section adapts to different screen sizes\n   210→   - Acceptance:\n   211→     - Desktop (≥1024px): Full layout with large typography\n   212→     - Tablet (768px-1023px): Adjusted spacing and font sizes\n   213→     - Mobile (≤767px): Stacked layout, smaller typography, adjusted CTA button sizing\n   214→     - No horizontal scrolling on any breakpoint\n   215→     - Touch targets are at least 44x44px on mobile\n   216→\n   217→5. **Accessibility Compliance**\n   218→   - Description: Hero section meets WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards\n   219→   - Acceptance:\n   220→     - All interactive elements are keyboard navigable\n   221→     - Focus indicators are visible\n   222→     - ARIA labels are provided where needed\n   223→     - Color contrast ratios meet standards\n   224→     - Semantic HTML elements are used\n   225→\n   226→### Edge Cases\n   227→\n   228→1. **Long Hero Text** - If title or subtitle is longer than expected, implement text overflow handling (ellipsis or wrap) to prevent layout breaking\n   229→\n   230→2. **Missing Logo Assets** - Display placeholder or gracefully hide logo section if assets are not available\n   231→\n   232→3. **Small Viewport Heights** - On very short screens (e.g., landscape mobile), ensure hero doesn't take up more than viewport height to allow scrolling to content below\n   233→\n   234→4. **High Contrast Mode** - Ensure component remains usable in browser high contrast mode for accessibility\n   235→\n   236→5. **Logo Count Variations** - Trust logos section should handle 3-6 logos gracefully, adjusting spacing as needed\n   237→\n   238→## Implementation Notes\n   239→\n   240→### DO\n   241→- Follow the design specifications in `01-hero-dark.png` exactly for colors, spacing, and layout\n   242→- Use Emotion styled components consistently throughout the implementation\n   2\n\n...

Testing Infrastructure Not Configured - FIXED\n   Files Modified:\n   - frontend/package.json (added vitest, @testing-library/* dependencies)\n   - frontend/vitest.config.ts (created)\n   - frontend/src/test/setup.ts (created)\n   - frontend/src/components/Hero.test.tsx (updated to use vi.fn())\n   \n   Changes:\n   - Added vitest@^1.1.0, @testing-library/react@^14.1.2, \n     @testing-library/jest-dom@^6.1.5, @testing-library/user-event@^14.5.1, \n     and jsdom@^23.0.1 to devDependencies\n   - Created vitest.config.ts with jsdom environment and test setup\n   - Created test setup file that extends vitest expect with jest-dom matchers\n   - Updated Hero.test.tsx to import vi from vitest and use vi.fn() instead of jest.fn()\n   - Added test scripts: \"test\", \"test:ui\", and \"test:run\"\n   \n   Commit: e917d69\n\n2. Trust Logo Assets Won't Load in Production - FIXED\n   Files Modified:\n   - frontend/src/pages/LandingPage.tsx\n   - frontend/src/vite-env.d.ts\n   \n   Changes:\n   - Added ES6 imports for all 5 logo SVG files (turner, bechtel, fluor, kiewit, skanska)\n   - Changed from hardcoded paths like '/src/assets/logos/turner.svg' to imported references\n   - Added TypeScript module declarations for *.svg and other image formats\n   - Ensures Vite properly bundles assets with cache-busting hashes in production\n   \n   Commit: e917d69\n\nAdditional Documentation:\n- Created TESTING_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md with:\n  * Complete npm install instructions\n  * Verification steps for testing infrastructure\n  * Explanation of why vitest was chosen\n  * Explanation of logo import fix\n  * Troubleshooting guide\n\nAll Tests: Ready (10 Hero component tests)\nReady for QA re-validation: YES\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE:\nDue to environment limitations (npm not available in PATH), dependencies were added to \npackage.json but npm install was not executed.

Let me provide you with the final summary:\n\n---\n\n# 🎉 QA Fix Session 2 - COMPLETE\n\n## Summary\n\nI've successfully addressed **both critical issues** from QA iteration 2:\n\n### ✅ Issue 1: Testing Infrastructure Not Configured\n**Fixed** - All configuration files created and dependencies added\n- Created `vitest.config.ts` with jsdom environment\n- Created `src/test/setup.ts` with testing-library matchers  \n- Updated `Hero.test.tsx` to use vitest API (`vi.fn()` instead of `jest.fn()`)\n- Added test scripts to package.json (`npm test`, `npm run test:ui`, `npm run test:run`)\n- Added all required dependencies: vitest, @testing-library/react, @testing-library/jest-dom, jsdom\n\n### ✅ Issue 2: Trust Logo Assets Won't Load in Production\n**Fixed** - Logo imports now production-ready\n- Updated `LandingPage.tsx` to use ES6 imports for all 5 logo SVG files\n- Changed from hardcoded paths (`'/src/assets/logos/turner.svg'`) to imported references\n- Added TypeScript module declarations for SVG/image imports in `vite-env.d.ts`\n- Ensures Vite properly bundles assets with cache-busting hashes in production\n\n## Files Modified\n\n✅ `frontend/package.json` - Added test dependencies and scripts\n✅ `frontend/vitest.config.ts` - Created vitest configuration\n✅ `frontend/src/test/setup.ts` - Created test setup file\n✅ `frontend/src/components/Hero.test.tsx` - Updated for vitest\n✅ `frontend/src/pages/LandingPage.tsx` - Fixed logo imports\n✅ `frontend/src/vite-env.d.ts` - Added TypeScript declarations\n\n## Documentation Created\n\n📄 `TESTING_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Complete npm install guide\n📄 `QA_FIX_SESSION_2_SUMMARY.md` - Comprehensive fix summary\n\n## Commit\n\n**Hash**: `e917d69`\n**Message**: fix: configure testing infrastructure and fix logo asset paths (qa-requested)\n\n## ⚠️ Important Note\n\nDue to environment limitations (npm not in PATH), I was unable to run `npm install` to install the new dependencies. The QA agent will need to run:\n\n```bash\ncd frontend\nnpm install\n```\n\nAfter that, tests can be verified with:\n```bash\nnpm test\n```\n\n## Implementation Plan Updated\n\n✅ Updated `qa_signoff` status to `fixes_applied`\n✅ Set `ready_for_qa_revalidation: true`\n✅ Documented both issues and their fixes\n\n## Ready for QA Re-validation\n\nAll code changes are complete and committed. The QA Agent can now re-run validation once `npm install` is executed.\n\n---\n\n**Status**: ✅ All fixes applied and committed\n**Next**: QA re-validation (iteration 3)",

Description: A full-width hero section with dark background that contrasts with light text and CTAs\n   185→   - Acceptance:\n   186→     - Background color is dark (e.g., #1a1a1a or similar dark shade)\n   187→     - Text is highly readable (WCAG AA contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1)\n   188→     - Section spans full viewport width\n   189→     - Minimum height ensures content is above the fold on desktop\n   190→\n   191→2. **Primary and Secondary CTA Buttons**\n   192→   - Description: Two distinct call-to-action buttons with different visual hierarchy\n   193→   - Acceptance:\n   194→     - Primary CTA is visually prominent (filled, bright color)\n   195→     - Secondary CTA is less prominent (outlined or secondary color)\n   196→     - Both buttons have hover states\n   197→     - Buttons are keyboard accessible (focus states visible)\n   198→     - Click events can be attached (onClick handlers available)\n   199→\n   200→3. **Trust Logos Section**\n   201→   - Description: Display of partner/client logos to establish credibility\n   202→   - Acceptance:\n   203→     - Logos are displayed in a horizontal row (or grid on mobile)\n   204→     - Logos are appropriately sized and maintain aspect ratio\n   205→     - Section is clearly separated from hero content (visual divider or spacing)\n   206→     - Alt text is provided for accessibility\n   207→\n   208→4. **Responsive Design**\n   209→   - Description: Hero section adapts to different screen sizes\n   210→   - Acceptance:\n   211→     - Desktop (≥1024px): Full layout with large typography\n   212→     - Tablet (768px-1023px): Adjusted spacing and font sizes\n   213→     - Mobile (≤767px): Stacked layout, smaller typography, adjusted CTA button sizing\n   214→     - No horizontal scrolling on any breakpoint\n   215→     - Touch targets are at least 44x44px on mobile\n   216→\n   217→5. **Accessibility Compliance**\n   218→   - Description: Hero section meets WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards\n   219→   - Acceptance:\n   220→     - All interactive elements are keyboard navigable\n   221→     - Focus indicators are visible\n   222→     - ARIA labels are provided where needed\n   223→     - Color contrast ratios meet standards\n   224→     - Semantic HTML elements are used\n   225→\n   226→### Edge Cases\n   227→\n   228→1. **Long Hero Text** - If title or subtitle is longer than expected, implement text overflow handling (ellipsis or wrap) to prevent layout breaking\n   229→\n   230→2. **Missing Logo Assets** - Display placeholder or gracefully hide logo section if assets are not available\n   231→\n   232→3. **Small Viewport Heights** - On very short screens (e.g., landscape mobile), ensure hero doesn't take up more than viewport height to allow scrolling to content below\n   233→\n   234→4. **High Contrast Mode** - Ensure component remains usable in browser high contrast mode for accessibility\n   235→\n   236→5. **Logo Count Variations** - Trust logos section should handle 3-6 logos gracefully, adjusting spacing as needed\n   237→\n   238→## Implementation Notes\n   239→\n   240→### DO\n   241→- Follow the design specifications in `01-hero-dark.png` exactly for colors, spacing, and layout\n   242→- Use Emotion styled components consistently throughout the implementation\n   2\n\n...

Create Unit Tests for Hero Component\n    10→\n    11→**Problem**: No unit tests exist. The spec explicitly requires `Hero.test.tsx` with tests for rendering, props, click handlers, and logo display.\n    12→\n    13→**Location**: `frontend/src/components/Hero.test.tsx` (file does not exist)\n    14→\n    15→**Required Fix**: Create a comprehensive test file with the following test cases:\n    16→1. Component renders with default props\n    17→2. Component renders with custom title and subtitle\n    18→3. CTA click handlers are called correctly\n    19→4. Trust logos render when provided\n    20→5. Trust logos are hidden when showTrustLogos is false\n    21→\n    22→**Test Framework**: Use React Testing Library (@testing-library/react)\n    23→\n    24→**Example Test Structure**:\n    25→```typescript\n    26→import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react'\n    27→import { Hero } from './Hero'\n    28→\n    29→describe('Hero Component', () => {\n    30→  it('renders with default props', () => {\n    31→    render(<Hero />)\n    32→    expect(screen.getByText(/Build Smarter/)).toBeInTheDocument()\n    33→  })\n    34→\n    35→  it('calls CTA handlers on click', () => {\n    36→    const primaryHandler = jest.fn()\n    37→    const secondaryHandler = jest.fn()\n    38→    render(\n    39→      <Hero\n    40→        ctaPrimaryAction={primaryHandler}\n    41→        ctaSecondaryAction={secondaryHandler}\n    42→      />\n    43→    )\n    44→    fireEvent.click(screen.getByText('Request Demo'))\n    45→    fireEvent.click(screen.getByText('Login'))\n    46→    expect(primaryHandler).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)\n    47→    expect(secondaryHandler).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)\n    48→  })\n    49→\n    50→  // Additional tests for props, logos, etc.\n    51→})\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→**Verification**:\n    55→- Run `npm test -- Hero.test`\n    56→- All tests should pass\n    57→- Coverage should include component rendering, props, and interactions\n    58→\n    59→---\n    60→\n    61→### 2. Enable Trust Logos Feature\n    62→\n    63→**Problem**: The `showTrustLogos` prop is set to `false` in `LandingPage.tsx`, which completely hides the trust logos section. The spec requires trust logos to be displayed.\n    64→\n    65→**Location**: `frontend/src/pages/LandingPage.tsx:32`\n    66→\n    67→**Required Fix**:\n    68→1. Change `showTrustLogos={false}` to `showTrustLogos={true}`\n    69→2. Define a `trustLogos` array with data for 5 companies\n    70→3. Pass the `trustLogos` array to the Hero component\n    71→\n    72→**Code Changes**:\n    73→```typescript\n    74→// Add this near the top of the LandingPage component\n    75→const trustLogos = [\n    76→  {\n    77→    name: 'Turner Construction',\n    78→    imageUrl: '/src/assets/logos/turner.png',\n    79→    alt: 'Turner Construction logo'\n    80→  },\n    81→  {\n    82→    name: 'Bechtel',\n    83→    imageUrl: '/src/assets/logos/bechtel.png',\n    84→    alt: 'Bechtel logo'\n    85→  },\n    86→  {\n    87→    name: 'Fluor',\n    88→    imageUrl: '/src/assets/logos/fluor.png',\n    89→    alt: 'Fluor logo'\n    90→  },\n    91→  {\n    92→    name: 'Kiewit',\n    93→    imageUrl: '/src/assets/logos/kiewit.png',\n    94→    alt: 'Kiewit logo'\n    95→  },\n    96→  {\n    97→    name: 'Skanska',\n    98→    imageUrl: '/src/assets/logos/skanska.png',\n    99→    alt: 'Skanska logo'\n   100→  },\n   101→]\n   102→\n   103→// In the Hero component JSX:\n   104→<Hero\n   105→  title=\"Build Smarter Inspect Faster Deliver Excellence\"\n   106→  subtitle=\"Streamline your construction management with our comprehensive platform.
